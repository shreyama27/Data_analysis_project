Tech For the Future

In 2018 the city of Seattle was given a survey asking them about their household’s access to technology and consists of questions like “What devices do you own?” and “How fast is your internet?”. These questions are important to tech company owners because if they find out that a large majority of people in a certain wealth bracket are missing technology, they could account for that with cheaper prices. This dataset was chosen because it is becoming more and more important to own technology to the point where it’s becoming impossible to overcome the lack of it. From this data, we hope to find out that certain people are at a significant disadvantage when it comes to owning technology and that we could use this information to help them get assistance they need
